# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Thank you for helping to keep the **NLIP** project secure.

If you discover a potential security vulnerability or issue, please report it **privately** to the maintainers, rather than publicly filing an issue.

**How to report:**
- **Email:** `[insert your security contact email here]`  
- **Details:** Please include as much information as possible to help us understand the nature and impact of the issue.

We will respond to your report promptly and keep you updated as we work toward a resolution.

## Disclosure Policy

We ask you to give us a reasonable time to investigate and mitigate the issue before any public disclosure.

Once the vulnerability is confirmed and resolved, appropriate public disclosure and credit will be given (unless you prefer anonymity).

## Scope

This policy applies to vulnerabilities in:
- The protocol specifications  
- Any official documentation  
- Any reference implementations maintained under this project  

Thank you for helping protect **NLIP** and its community!
