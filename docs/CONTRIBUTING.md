# Contributing to NLIP

## Welcome!

We are excited you're interested in contributing to the development of the NLIP protocol. This project aims to create an open, community-driven standard for natural language interaction between agents.

This project values collaboration, openness, and technical excellence.

## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute:

- **Participate in discussions** — propose ideas, improvements, or questions  
- **Submit an issue** — identify gaps, suggest improvements, or report ambiguities  
- **Propose a change** — submit a draft, amendment, or clarification to the specification  
- **Implement a reference example** — help create open-source examples that demonstrate compliance  
- **Review others’ contributions** — thoughtful feedback is highly valued  
- **Work on tooling** — develop test suites, validators, or supporting libraries

## Before You Start

Please review these documents:

- [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT?id=code-of-conduct) – expected behavior in all community spaces  
- [Security Policy](SECURITY?id=security-policy) – how to report vulnerabilities safely  

## How to Contribute

1. **Open an Issue**  
   If you have a proposal, question, or feedback, start by opening an Issue. Clearly describe:  
   - What you're proposing or asking  
   - Why it's valuable  
   - Any prior discussion or research  

   Issues can also be used to discuss major technical decisions before a pull request.

2. **Fork the Repository and Create a Branch**  
   When ready to suggest changes:  
   1. Fork the repository  
   2. Create a feature branch:  
      ```bash
      git checkout -b my-proposal
      ```  
   3. Make your edits (spec text, examples, etc.)  

   If you are submitting a draft protocol change, please use the `/drafts/` directory if available.

3. **Submit a Pull Request**  
   When submitting your PR:  
   - Describe the change clearly  
   - Link relevant Issues, if possible  
   - Indicate whether the change is a major, minor, or editorial update  

   Be prepared to iterate based on community feedback. We follow a collaborative, consensus-driven process for changes.

## Specification Evolution Process

We roughly follow these stages:

| Stage     | Description                                                         |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Proposal  | A rough idea or need, discussed via Issue                           |
| Draft     | A concrete text proposal, submitted via Pull Request                |
| Review    | Community and technical review, refinement                          |
| Consensus | Broad agreement from maintainers and stakeholders                   |
| Merge     | Accepted into the working specification or published drafts         |

> **Note:** Major changes may require multiple rounds of feedback and discussion.

## Style and Formatting

- Write in clear, precise English.  
- Prefer active voice and consistent terminology.  
- Follow existing document structure and formatting conventions (e.g., header hierarchy).  
- Mirror the structure and tone of existing sections when submitting changes.  

## Community

We are building a professional, welcoming, and open environment for collaboration. All contributions are expected to uphold our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT?id=code-of-conduct).

Thank you for being part of the **NLIP** project! Together, we are building the future of natural language interaction.
